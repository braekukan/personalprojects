Hello,

This is a repository of all my perosnal projects so far throughout my college career at Drexel University. 

Projects include:

**- A Baseball Card Value Lookup:**

      - This program was coded in Python(version 3+)
      
      - This program utilizies the modules, tkinter and BeautifulSoup.
      
      - The tkinter module is the aspect of this program that makes it a GUI. 
      
      - The user is prompted with a window that pops up on the screen with area to input the player's name and card number. 
      
      - From there the implementations from BeautifulSoup will webscrape and return to the user the average value of the card. 

**- Dead Tide**

      - This game is currently being developed in Unity, and using C# scripts.
      
      - This is a first person inspired zombie game. 
      
      - The user is put into this abandonded military army base located near the shore and they are faced to fight off against 
      
         endless waves of zombies that they are trying to kill them.
